An algoritm is a set of well-deffined instructions to solve a particular problem

Algorithm to add two numbers:
Two numbers 'a' and 'b' as Inputs =>
                Algorithm steps: 1.Add numbers using '+' 2.Return the value =>
                                                                        Output: Sum of 'a' and 'b'

Characteristics:
  Well defined inputs and outputs
  Each step should be clear and unambiguous
  Language independent

Time and space complexity
Time complexity - Amount of time taken by an algorithm in terms of its input size.
Space complexity - Amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size

By evaluating agains the input size, the analysis not only machine independent but the comparison is also more appropriate.

How to represent complexity?
Asymptotic notations
-Mathematical tools to represent time and space complexity
1. Big-O Notation (O-notation) - Worst case complexity
2. Omega Notation (Ω-notation) - Best case complexity
3. Theta Notation (Θ-notation) - Average case complexity

*** Big-O Notation ***
The worst case complexity of an algorithm is represented using the Big-O notation
Big-O notation describes the complexity of an algorithm using algebraic terms

It has two important characteristics
- It expressed in terms of the input
- It focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught up in the minute details
